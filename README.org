* Description

This code is based on cl-cpp-generator2/example/08_copernicus_radar.
The code was started in December 2020.

I learned a bit more about how to split C++ code into modules and
tried to apply this here.  Each cpp file also has a hpp file with
classes and function definitions.

I added a CMake based build system and attempted to embed Python.
