* Description

This code is based on cl-cpp-generator2/example/08_copernicus_radar.
The code was started in December 2020.

I learned a bit more about how to split C++ code into modules and
tried to apply this here.  Each cpp file also has a hpp file with
classes and function definitions.

I added a CMake based build system and attempted to embed Python.

* Compilation
#+begin_example
cd source
mkdir build
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja
#+end_example

* How to run

Download a raw copernicus sentinel 1 dataset from https://scihub.copernicus.eu.

I used this link (not sure if it works):
